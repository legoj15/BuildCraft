 * {@code GuiBookModelRenderState} / {@code GuiEntityRenderState}: a record whose fields pin down
 * the viewport rectangle and scale, with a convenience constructor that computes the clipped
 * {@code bounds} from the raw coordinates plus optional scissor.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why rotation isn't a field:</b> the yaw animation is sampled from wall-clock time inside
 * {@link BlueprintPipRenderer#renderToTexture}. Keeping it out of the state means
 * {@code canBeReusedFor} (inherited from the base class, matches on texture dimensions) can return
 * {@code true} every frame, so we don't pay the cost of reallocating the GPU texture on every
 * mouse-hover frame just because the blueprint is "animating".
